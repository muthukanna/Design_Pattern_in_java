Java Project: Design Patterns
This project demonstrates five creational design patterns, providing structured approaches to object instantiation in Java. It is implemented using JavaSE-21 and organized into different packages, each focusing on a specific design pattern:
1. Abstract Factory Pattern (com.creational.abstractfactorydesignpattern)
Encapsulates a group of related factory methods to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Useful when multiple object types share common interfaces.
2. Builder Pattern (com.creational.builderdesignpattern)
Simplifies complex object creation by providing a step-by-step approach. It separates construction from representation, making the code more readable and scalable.
3. Factory Pattern (com.creational.factorydesignpattern)
Provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic. It relies on an interface or superclass and helps decouple object creation from implementation.
4. Prototype Pattern (com.creational.prototype)
Allows creating a new object by copying an existing one, instead of relying on direct instantiation. It's useful when object creation is costly.
5. Singleton Pattern (com.creational.singletondesignpattern)
Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it. This is useful for managing shared resources like configuration settings or logging utilities.
